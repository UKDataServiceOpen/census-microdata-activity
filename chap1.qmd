# R code for module activity

## 1- Install and load the main packages

### Install packages

If any of the below packages is not installed on your computer, please install it. Remember to delete the **#** symbol before running the code.

```{r, eval=FALSE}

#install.packages("tidyverse")
#install.packages("ggplot2")
#install.packages("dplyr")
#install.packages("ggrepel")
#install.packages("patchwork")
#install.packages("gridExtra")

```

### Load packages

```{r, eval=FALSE}

library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(ggrepel)
library(patchwork)
library(gridExtra)
library(haven)

```

## 2- Load the dataset and make a copy

```{r, eval=FALSE}

publicmicrodatateachingsample <- read_sav("data/publicmicrodatateachingsample.sav")

census2021teaching <- publicmicrodatateachingsample

```

Important: Remember to change to pathway to your dataset accordingly. 

If the **read_sav** code does not work, you can use the **Import Dataset** button in the Environment pane to load the dataset in R.

## 3- Drop unnecessary variables

```{r, eval=FALSE}

census2021teaching <- census2021teaching[,c("health_in_general",
                                            "hours_per_week_worked",
                                            "resident_age_7d","sex", 
                                            "ethnic_group_tb_6a",
                                            "approx_social_grade")]
```

## 4- Exploratory analysis

### 4.1- Univariate analysis 

### 4.1.1 Univariate analysis for health in general and hours worked

##### Frequencies for health in general and hours worked

```{r, eval=FALSE}

table(census2021teaching$health_in_general)

table(census2021teaching$hours_per_week_worked)

```

##### Percentages for health in general and hours worked


```{r, eval=FALSE}

prop.table(table(census2021teaching$health_in_general)) * 100

prop.table(table(census2021teaching$hours_per_week_worked)) * 100

```

You can also calculate these frequencies and percentages with appropriate labels.

##### Frequencies and percentages with labels for health in general and hours worked

  
```{r, eval=FALSE}

census2021teaching %>%
  mutate(
    health_code = as.integer(as.character(health_in_general)),
    health_label = factor(
      health_code,
      levels = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, -8),
      labels = c("Very good", "Good", "Fair", "Bad", "Very bad", "Does not apply")
    )
  ) %>%
  count(health_label) %>%
  mutate(percent = round(100 * n / sum(n), 1))


census2021teaching %>%
  mutate(
    hours_code = as.integer(as.character(hours_per_week_worked)),
    hours_label = factor(
      hours_code,
      levels = c(1, 2, 3, 4, -8),
      labels = c("[0 – 15]", "[16 – 30]", "[31 – 48]", "[49 and +]", "Does not apply")
    )
  ) %>%
  count(hours_label) %>%
  mutate(percent = round(100 * n / sum(n), 1))

```

You can also generate pie charts for better visualization

### a) Pie chart for Health in general

##### a.1) Create a labelled health variable
  
```{r, eval=FALSE}

      levels = c(1,2,3,4,5,-8),
      labels = c("Very good", "Good", "Fair", "Bad", "Very bad", "Not applicable")
    )
  ) %>%
  filter(!is.na(health_label)) %>%
  count(health_label, name = "n") %>%
  mutate(
    pct = round(100 * n / sum(n), 1),
    label = paste0(health_label, " (", pct, "%)")
  )

```

##### a.2) Plot pie chart


```{r, eval=FALSE}

                   position = position_stack(vjust = 0.5),
                   show.legend = FALSE,
                   size = 3) +
  labs(title = "Distribution of general health", fill = "Health status") +
